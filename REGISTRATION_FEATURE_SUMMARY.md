## Data Transformation

### Faculty Multi-Department Handling:
```typescript
// Frontend: Array of departments
departments: ["Computer Engineering", "Mathematics"]

// Backend: Comma-separated string
department: "Computer Engineering, Mathematics"
```

### User Type Derivation:
```typescript
const getUserType = () => {
  if (role === "faculty") return "faculty"
  if (role === "student" && programType === "bachelor") return "bachelor_student"
  if (role === "student" && programType === "master") return "master_student"
}
```

## Next Steps

### To Test:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to `/register`
3. Test registration for:
   - Bachelor student
   - Master student
   - Faculty member with multiple departments

### To Deploy:
1. Ensure Supabase database has the updated schema
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test email verification flow
4. Deploy to production

### Future Enhancements:
1. Profile page to display all new fields
2. Department-based filtering of users
