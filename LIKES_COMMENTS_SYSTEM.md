## File Structure

```
lib/
  comments.ts              # Comments & likes library (core functions)

components/
  like-button.tsx          # Reusable like button component
  comments-section.tsx     # Full comments UI with nested replies
  blog-interactions.tsx    # Wrapper for likes + comments + share

app/

    [id]/
      page.tsx             # Blog detail page (integrated)
```

## Usage

### In a Blog Page

```tsx
import { BlogInteractions } from "@/components/blog-interactions"

  blogId={blog.id}
  initialLikes={blog.likes}
  blogTitle={blog.title}
  blogUrl={`/blogs/${blog.id}`}
/>
```

### Standalone Like Button

```tsx
import { LikeButton } from "@/components/like-button"

<LikeButton
  isLiked={isLiked}
  likesCount={likesCount}
  onLike={handleLike}
  onUnlike={handleUnlike}
  size="md"
  showCount={true}
/>
```

### Standalone Comments

```tsx
import { Comments } from "@/components/comments-section"

<Comments blogId={blogId} />
```

## API Functions

### Blog Likes

```typescript
// Check if user liked a blog
hasUserLikedBlog(blogId: string, userId: string)

// Like a blog
likeBlog(blogId: string, userId: string)

// Unlike a blog
unlikeBlog(blogId: string, userId: string)

// Get blog likes count
getBlogLikesCount(blogId: string)
```

### Comments

```typescript
// Get all comments for a blog (with nested replies)
getComments(blogId: string, userId?: string)

// Get comment count
getCommentCount(blogId: string)

// Create a comment
createComment(blogId: string, content: string, authorId: string, parentId?: string)

### Real-time Subscriptions

```typescript
// Subscribe to blog likes updates
subscribeToBlogLikes(blogId: string, callback: (payload: any) => void)

// Subscribe to comments updates
subscribeToComments(blogId: string, callback: (payload: any) => void)

// Subscribe to comment likes updates
subscribeToCommentLikes(callback: (payload: any) => void)
```

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### Likes Table
- ‚úÖ Everyone can view likes
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users can create likes (only for themselves)
- ‚úÖ Users can delete their own likes

#### Comments Table
- ‚úÖ Everyone can view comments
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users can create comments (only for themselves)
- ‚úÖ Users can update their own comments
- ‚úÖ Users can delete their own comments

#### Comment Likes Table
- ‚úÖ Everyone can view comment likes
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users can create comment likes (only for themselves)
- ‚úÖ Users can delete their own comment likes

### Database Constraints
- `UNIQUE(user_id, blog_id)` on likes table - prevents duplicate likes
- `UNIQUE(user_id, comment_id)` on comment_likes table - prevents duplicate likes
- Foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` - clean up orphaned records

## Features Explained

### Optimistic UI Updates
Both the like button and comment actions use optimistic updates:
- UI updates immediately when user clicks
- If API call fails, UI reverts to previous state
- Provides instant feedback and better UX

### Nested Comments
- Comments can have replies (parent_id references)
- Maximum depth: 3 levels (configurable)
- Hierarchical structure built on client-side
- Replies load with parent comment

### Real-time Updates
- Uses Supabase Realtime (Postgres changes)
- Automatic UI updates when:
  - Someone likes/unlikes a blog
  - Someone posts/edits/deletes a comment
  - Someone likes/unlikes a comment
- No page refresh needed

### Comment Actions
- **Reply**: Add a nested reply to any comment (up to depth limit)
- **Edit**: Update your own comment content (marks as edited)
- **Delete**: Remove your own comment (with confirmation dialog)
- **Like**: Like any comment (with heart animation)

### Social Sharing
- Twitter/X
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- WhatsApp
- Copy link to clipboard

## Migration Instructions

### Apply Migration

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or using SQL directly in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy and paste: supabase/migrations/20231016_add_comment_likes.sql
```

### Update Existing Comments (Optional)
If you have existing comments, initialize their like counts:

```sql
UPDATE public.comments SET likes_count = 0 WHERE likes_count IS NULL;
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**
   - `idx_comment_likes_comment_id` - fast comment like lookups
   - `idx_comment_likes_user_id` - fast user like lookups
   - `idx_comments_blog_id` - fast comment queries by blog

2. **Batch Queries**
   - Load all comments in one query
   - Check all liked comments in one query
   - Build hierarchy on client-side

3. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Instant UI feedback
   - Reduced perceived latency
   - Better user experience

4. **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Efficient Postgres change tracking
   - Only updates when data changes
   - Automatic cleanup on unmount

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Comment reactions (üëç üòÑ üéâ ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- [ ] Comment threading with "show more replies"
- [ ] Comment sorting (newest, oldest, most liked)
- [ ] Comment search
- [ ] Mention users (@username)
- [ ] Rich text comments (markdown)
- [ ] Comment notifications
- [ ] Report inappropriate comments
- [ ] Pin important comments (admin)
- [ ] Bookmarking blogs

## Troubleshooting

### Comments not appearing
- Check if user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors

- Check if blog status is "published"

### Likes not working
- Verify user is logged in
- Check if duplicate like constraint is causing issues
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify helper functions exist in database

### Real-time not updating
- Check Supabase Realtime is enabled
- Verify channel subscriptions are not blocked
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Ensure cleanup functions are working (useEffect return)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Review Supabase logs
3. Verify database schema matches migration
4. Check RLS policies are correctly applied
