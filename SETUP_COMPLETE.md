## üìã Setup Required

### Supabase Storage Setup (One-Time)

You've already created the `avatars` bucket, but you need to add the RLS policies.

**Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;

-- Policy 1: Anyone can view avatars (public read)
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users can upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Policy 3: Users can update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Policy 4: Users can delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

**This is also saved in:** `supabase/migrations/20231018_storage_policies.sql`
